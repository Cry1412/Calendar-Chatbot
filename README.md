# AI Scheduling Assistant with Telegram Integration

A comprehensive scheduling system that combines a web-based AI assistant with a Telegram bot for seamless appointment management. The system integrates Google Calendar, OpenAI GPT-3.5, and provides both web and Telegram interfaces for appointment scheduling.

## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Overview

### System Architecture

The application follows a **microservices-inspired architecture** with three main components:

1. **Calendar Assistant Backend** (Node.js/Express)
   - Handles Google Calendar integration via OAuth2
   - Processes natural language requests using OpenAI GPT-3.5
   - Manages appointment requests with SQLite database
   - Provides RESTful API endpoints

2. **Calendar Assistant Frontend** (React.js)
   - Modern, responsive web interface
   - Real-time chat with AI assistant
   - Appointment request management dashboard
   - Google Calendar authentication flow

3. **Telegram Bot** (Node.js)
   - Provides mobile-first appointment scheduling
   - Integrates with Calendar Assistant backend
   - Supports both Vietnamese and English commands
   - Interactive inline keyboards for appointment selection

### Key Architectural Decisions

**Why this architecture?**

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a specific responsibility, making the system modular and maintainable
- **Scalability**: Components can be deployed independently and scaled based on demand
- **User Experience**: Multiple interfaces (web + Telegram) provide flexibility for different user preferences
- **Data Persistence**: SQLite database ensures appointment requests survive server restarts
- **Real-time Integration**: Telegram bot communicates with web backend for unified appointment management

**Technology Choices:**

- **Node.js/Express**: Fast, event-driven backend with excellent async support
- **React.js**: Component-based frontend with modern hooks and state management
- **SQLite**: Lightweight, serverless database perfect for this use case
- **Google Calendar API**: Industry-standard calendar integration
- **OpenAI GPT-3.5**: Advanced natural language processing for conversational AI
- **Telegram Bot API**: Robust messaging platform with rich interactive features
