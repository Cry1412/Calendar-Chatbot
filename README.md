### Natural Language Processing

The assistant understands various ways to express the same intent:

**Scheduling Examples:**
- "Schedule a meeting with John"
- "Book an appointment with Sarah"
- "Create an event with the team"
- "Set up a call with Maya"

**Time Expressions:**
- "tomorrow at 3 PM"
- "next Monday at 10 AM"
- "Friday afternoon"
- "in 2 hours"

## üîí Security & Privacy

- **OAuth 2.0**: Secure Google Calendar authentication
- **No Data Storage**: Calendar data is not stored locally
- **API Security**: All API keys are stored in environment variables
- **HTTPS Ready**: Configured for production deployment

## üöÄ Production Deployment

### Environment Variables
Update the following for production:
- `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI`: Your production domain
- `NODE_ENV`: Set to "production"
- `SESSION_SECRET`: Use a strong, random secret

### Google Cloud Console
1. Update OAuth consent screen for production
2. Add production redirect URIs
3. Configure authorized domains

### Deployment Options
- **Heroku**: Easy deployment with environment variables
- **Vercel**: Great for frontend deployment
- **AWS/GCP**: Full control over infrastructure
- **Docker**: Containerized deployment

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Not authenticated with Google Calendar"**
- Ensure you've completed the OAuth flow
- Check that your Google Cloud Console credentials are correct
- Verify the redirect URI matches exactly

**"OpenAI API Error"**
- Check your OpenAI API key is valid
- Ensure you have sufficient API credits
- Verify the API key is correctly set in environment variables

**"Port already in use"**
- Change the PORT in your .env file
- Kill any existing processes on the port
- Use `lsof -i :3001` to find conflicting processes

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting `NODE_ENV=development` in your backend `.env` file.
